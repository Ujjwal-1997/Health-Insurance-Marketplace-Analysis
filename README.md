Health Insurance Marketplace Analysis - This project uses 'rate.csv.tiny.zip' (file having data about health insurance issuers and plans) and 'nst-est2016-01.xslx' (excel file that has US states year-wise population data). 'rate.csv.tiny.zip' file can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hhs/health-insurance-marketplace?select=Rate.csv and renamed if required. 'nst-est2016-01.xslx' file is attached and both files are  needed to run main project file 'Health Insurance Marketplace Analysis.ipynb'. Python is used for this project to manipulate data and answer some key business questions, also supported by data visualisations.
