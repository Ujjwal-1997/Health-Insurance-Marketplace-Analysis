Health Insurance Marketplace Analysis - This project uses 'rate.csv.tiny.zip' (file having data about health insurance issuers and plans) and 'nst-est2016-01.xslx' (excel file that has US states year-wise population data). Both these files are attached and needed to run main project file 'Health Insurance Marketplace Analysis.ipynb'. Python is used for this project to manipulate data and answer some key business questions, also supported by data visualisations.
